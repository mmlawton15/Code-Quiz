## What is the point of this app?
This is my 4th challenge of the bootcamp where I was tasked with creating a coding quiz from scratch. This app needed to use our previous knowledge of HTML, Javascript, and CSS to mimic the mockup given to us at the beginning of the assignment.

## What does it do?
Ideally, it will mimic the kind of coding quizzes we will encounter while interviewing for jobs. It's multiple choice and you will be graded at the end based on your choices throughout the quiz.
It's multiple choice, and a positive sound will play for right answers and increase your score. If you chose the wron answer, a negative sound will play and you won't get points. At the end, you can see high scores from previous plays and play again.

## How did you create it?
I created the webpage with HTML, the styling for the page with CSS, and the logic behind the interactivity with Javascript.

## Where can I find this?
You can find this either at my Github Repo(https://github.com/mmlawton15/challenge-four-snowflake) or at the Live URL (https://mmlawton15.github.io/challenge-four-snowflake/)

## What does it look like?
You can view a preview of what this looks like here: https://github.com/mmlawton15/challenge-four-snowflake/issues/1
